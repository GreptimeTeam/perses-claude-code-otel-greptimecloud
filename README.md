# Visualization Workbench

Get started with GreptimeCloud's intuitive visualization platform, designed to
help you create, manage, and view stunning dashboards and time-series data.

## Key Features

### Dashboard as Code

GreptimeCloud's dashboard platform is built on the open-source [Perses
project](https://perses.dev), prioritizing openness in format and
exchangeability. All dashboards created on our platform are defined in pure JSON
files, allowing seamless import and export with existing dashboard formats. This
means you can easily transfer your dashboards to GreptimeCloud or vice versa.

### Git Integration

All dashboards you create on GreptimeCloud are managed by a Git-compatible
backend, granting you the flexibility to work online or locally. You can edit
directly in our web UI or clone the repository to your local machine,
import/export dashboards, and reflect changes in real-time across all platforms.

## Getting Started

Before diving into dashboard creation, ensure that you have set up a
Prometheus-compatible data source for ingesting data into your GreptimeCloud
instance. Now it's time to create your first dashboard.

1. Click the **"New File"** button on the sidebar to start from scratch and
   build your dashboard.
2. Alternatively, click the **"Import Dashboard"** option to import our
   pre-configured Perses dashboard if your data source matches.

Copy the Git URL to clone the source files locally, make modifications as
needed, and push the updates back to reflect changes on our web UI.
